- 👋 Hi, I’m @123Lniner!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and space!
- 🌱 I’m currently a 6th grader in middle school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any space-related games (as long as it's either JavaScript or HTML).
- 📫 Unfortunately, I'd rather not show my contact information.
- 😄 Pronouns: He, him
- ⚡ Fun fact: You can find me on Roblox (123L_niner), Besiege (lriver1), or Fortnite (lriver123).

Please don't open the main page in a new tab, rather, open it in this tab because there is a button that will be useless if opened in a new tab.

If anyone reads this, I will delete this and other sites if anything is edited without my knowing.
